# Sentiment-Classification-from-Reviews
This project aims to classify the sentiment of human generated IMDB movie reviews as either positive or negative labels. As, neural networks don't accept text inputs directly so, we'll have to transform the textual inputs data to numerical form so that the neural networks can discover correlation. 
The file 'reviews.txt' consists of 25000 movie reviews and 'labels.txt' consists the corresponding label as POSITIVE or NEGATIVE.
